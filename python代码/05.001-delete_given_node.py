Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

    4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9
Example 1:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
Example 2:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
Note:

The linked list will have at least two elements.
All of the nodes' values will be unique.
The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
Do not return anything from your function.


解题思路
这是一个非常简单的单链表的题，稍微拐了一点弯。一般删除一个节点是通过上一个节点来操作，现在只给了当前节点，那么只能将后一节点的值赋给当前节点，将后一节点删掉，则相当于删掉了“当前节点”。
